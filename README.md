# 🔑 Password Generator with Python

Generates a random, secure password based on the length the user chooses (up to 16 characters). It uses a mix of: <br />
• Uppercase letters (A–Z) <br />
• Lowercase letters (a–z) <br />
• Numbers (0–9) <br />
• Special characters (!@#$%^&*()-_) <br />

It also checks for valid input, making sure the user enters a number between 1 and 16; cannot be 0 or negative. Once a valid length is entered, the program instantly builds and displays a password using Python’s random module.
